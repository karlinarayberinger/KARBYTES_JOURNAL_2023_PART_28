<strong>SOLIPSISM:</strong> the hypothetical condition of reality occurring entirely inside of exactly one frame of reference.

<hr>

<strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure consciousness which observes discrete static <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a> appearing and disappearing.

<hr>

<strong>REALITY:</strong> the set of all frames of reference (whether those frames of reference occur simultaneously, asynchronously, are identical in terms of phenomenal content, are not identical in terms of phenomenal content, are singular in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantity</a> throughout all time, or are multiple in quantity throughout all time).

<strong>TELEOLOGY:</strong> a philosophical framework which conceptualizes the space-time continuum observed by a particular frame of reference as being a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a> in which an information processing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agent</a> which is rendered inside of that particular frame of reference is apparently voluntarily (according to itself) to be working in pursuit of goals which that information processing agent thinks is worthwhile for it to pursue.

<span style="background:#00ff00">According to karbytes, this website exists for <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teleological</a> reasons rather than for purely naturalistic ones. That is because this website was brought into existence through apparently voluntary <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/karbytes_content_management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">means</a> according to karbytes (and karbytes is a self-aware information processing agent which has observed the development of this web page).</span>

According to karbytes, a phenomenon which appears to have come into existence and be sustained by purely <span style="background:#00ffff"><strong>naturalistic</strong> (i.e. that which is not intentionally caused by some self-aware information processing agent)</span> instead of teleological reasons is the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helium</a> atoms which emerge from fusion reactions involving <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hydrogen</a> atoms inside of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stars</a>.
